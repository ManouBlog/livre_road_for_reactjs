    <h1>Foreword</h1>
    <p>
The Road to learn React teaches you the fundamentals of React. You will build a real world
application along the way in plain React without complicated tooling. Everything from project setup
to deployment on a server will be explained for you. The book comes with additional referenced
reading material and exercises with each chapter. After reading the book, you will be able to build
your own applications in React. The material is kept up to date by me and the community.
In the Road to learn React, I want to offer a foundation before you start to dive into the broader React
ecosystem. It has less tooling and less external state management, but a lot of information about
React. It explains general concepts, patterns and best practices in a real world React application.
You will learn to build your own React application. It covers real world features like pagination,
client-side caching and interactions such as searching and sorting. Additionally, you will transition
from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6 along the way. I hope this book captures my enthusiasm for
React and JavaScript and helps you to get started with it.

    <h1>About the Author</h1>
    <p>
        Robin Wieruch is a german software and web engineer who is dedicated to learn and teach
programming in JavaScript. After graduating from university with a masters degree in computer
science, he hasn’t stopped learning every day on his own. His experiences from the startup world,
where he used JavaScript excessively during his professional time and spare time, gave him the
opportunity to teach others about these topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a few years, Robin worked closely with a great team of engineers at a company called Small
Improvements on a large scale application. The company builds a SaaS product enabling customers to
create a feedback culture at their company. Under the hood, the application worked with JavaScript
in the frontend and Java in the backend. In the frontend, the first iteration was written in Java with
the Wicket Framework and jQuery. When the first generation of SPAs became popular, the company
migrated to Angular 1.x for the frontend application. After using Angular for more than 2 years, it
became clear that Angular wasn’t the best solution to work with state intense applications back in
the days. That’s why the company made the final jump to React and Redux that has enabled it to
operate on a large scale successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
        During his time in the company, Robin regularly wrote articles about web development on his
personal website. He noticed that people would give him great feedback on his articles that allowed
him to improve his writing and teaching style. Article after article, Robin grew in his ability to teach
others. Whereas the first article was packed with too much stuff that could be quite overwhelming
for students, the articles improved over time by focussing and teaching only one subject.
Nowadays, Robin is self-employed to teach others. He finds it a fulfilling activity to see students
thrive by giving them clear objectives and a short feedback loop. That’s one thing you would learn
at a feedback company, wouldn’t you? But without coding himself he wouldn’t be able to teach
things. That’s why he invests his remaining time in programming. You can find more information
about Robin and ways to support and work with him on his website1.

    <h1>How to read it?</h1>
    <p>
        The book is my attempt to teach React while you will write an application. It is a practical guide to
learn React and not a reference work about React. You will write a Hacker News application that
interacts with a real world API. Among several interesting topics, it covers state management in
React, caching and interactions (sorting and searching). On the way you will learn best practices
and patterns in React.
In addition, the book gives you a transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. React embraces
a lot of JavaScript ES6 features and I want to show you how you can use them.
In general, each chapter of the book will build up on the previous chapter. Each chapter will teach you
something new. Don’t rush through the book. You should internalize each step. You could apply your
own implementations and read more about the topic. After each chapter I give you some reading
material and exercises. If you really want to learn React, I highly recommend to read the extra
material and do some hands on exercises. After you have read a chapter, make yourself comfortable
with the learnings before you continue.
In the end, you will have a complete React application in production. I am very keen to see your
results, so please text me when you have finished the book. The final chapter of the book will give
you a handful of options to continue your React journey. In general you will find a lot of React
related topics on my personal website28.
Since you are reading the book, I guess you are new to React. That’s perfect. In the end, I hope to
get your feedback to improve the material to enable everyone to learn React. You can have a direct
impact on GitHub29 or text me on Twitter30.

    <h1>
        Introduction to React
    </h1>
    <p>
        The chapter gives you an introduction to React. You may ask yourself: Why should I learn React in
the first place? The chapter might give you the answer to that question. Afterward, you will dive into
the ecosystem by bootstrapping your first React application from scratch with zero-configuration.
Along the way, you will get an introduction to JSX and ReactDOM. So be prepared for your first
React components.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Hi, my name is React.
    </h1>
    <p>
        Why should you bother to learn React? In recent years single page applications (SPA31) have
become popular. Frameworks like Angular, Ember and Backbone helped JavaScript developers to
build modern web applications beyond the usage of vanilla JavaScript and jQuery. The list of
these popular solutions is not exhaustive. There exists a wide range of SPA frameworks. When
you consider the release dates, most of them are among the first generation of SPAs: Angular 2010,
Backbone 2010 and Ember 2011.
The initial React release was 2013 by Facebook. React is not an SPA framework but a view library. It
is the V in the MVC32 (model view controller). It only enables you to render components as viewable
elements in a browser. Yet the whole ecosystem around React makes it possible to build single page
applications.
But why should you consider using React over the first generation of SPA frameworks? While the
first generation of frameworks tried to solve a lot of things at once, React only helps you to build
your view layer. It’s a library and not a framework. The idea behind it: Your view is a hierarchy of
composable components.
In React you can keep the focus on your view layer before you introduce more aspects to your
application. Every other aspect is another building block for your SPA. These building blocks are
essential to build a mature application. They come with two advantages.
First, you can learn the building blocks step by step. You don’t have to worry about understanding
them altogether. It is different from a framework that gives you every building block from the start.
This book focuses on React as the first building block. More building blocks follow eventually.
Second, all building blocks are interchangeable. It makes the ecosystem around React such an
innovative place. Multiple solutions are competing with each other. You can pick the most appealing
solution for you and your use case.
The first generation of SPA frameworks arrived at an enterprise level. They are more rigid. React
stays innovative and gets adopted by multiple tech thought leader companies like Airbnb, Netflix
and of course Facebook33. All of them invest in the future of React and are content with React and
the ecosystem itself.
React is probably one of the best choices for building modern web applications nowadays. It only
delivers the view layer, but the React ecosystem is a whole flexible and interchangeable framework34.
React has a slim API, an amazing ecosystem and a great community. You can read about my
experiences why I moved from Angular to React35. I highly recommend to have an understanding
why you would choose React over another framework or library. After all, everyone is keen to
experience where React will lead us in the next years.
    </p>
    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    <p>
        If you are coming from a different SPA framework or library, you should already be familiar with the
basics of web development. If you have just started in web development, you should feel comfortable
with HTML, CSS and JavaScript ES5 to learn React. The book will smoothly transition to JavaScript
ES6 and beyond. I encourage you to join the official Slack Group39 for the book to get help or to help
others.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Editor and Terminal
    </h1>
    <p>
        What about the development environment? You will need a running editor or IDE and terminal
(command line tool). You can follow my setup guide40. It is adjusted for MacOS users, but you can
substitute most of the tools for other operating system. There is a ton of articles out there that will
show you how to setup a web development environment in a more elaborated way for your OS.
Optionally, you can use git and GitHub on your own, while conducting the exercises in the book, to
keep your projects and the progress in repositories on GitHub. There exists a little guide41 on how
to use these tools. But once again, it is not mandatory for the book and can be overwhelming when
learning everything from scratch. So you can skip it if you are a newcomer in web development to
focus on the essential parts taught in this book.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Node and NPM
    </h1>
    <P>
        Last but not least, you will need an installation of node and npm42. Both are used to manage libraries
you will need along the way. In this book, you will install external node packages via npm (node
package manager). These node packages can be libraries or whole frameworks.
You can verify your versions of node and npm on the command line. If you don’t get any output in
the terminal, you need to install node and npm first. These are only my versions during the time
writing this book:
    </P>
    <p>
        Command Line
    </p>
    <pre>
        node --version
       *v8.9.4 <br>
      npm --version
      *v5.6.0
    </pre>
    <h1>node and npm</h1>
    <p>
        This chapter gives you a little crash course in node and npm. It is not exhaustive, but you will get
all the necessary tools. If you are familiar with both of them, you can skip the chapter.
The node package manager (npm) allows you to install external node packages from the command
line. These packages can be a set of utility functions, libraries or whole frameworks. They are the
dependencies of your application. You can either install these packages to your global node package
folder or to your local project folder.
Global node packages are accessible from everywhere in the terminal and you have to install them
only once to your global directory. You can install a global package by typing in your terminal:
    </p>
    <p>Command Line</p>
    <pre>
        npm install -g &lt;package&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        The -g flag tells npm to install the package globally. Local packages are used in your application.
For instance, React as a library will be a local package which can be required in your application for
usage. You can install it via the terminal by typing:
    </p>
    <p>Command Line</p>
    <pre>npm install &lt;package&gt;</pre>
    <p>In the case of React it would be:</p>
    <p>
        Command Line
    </p>
    <pre>npm install react</pre>
    <p>
        The installed package will automatically appear in a folder called node_modules/ and will be listed
in the package.json file next to your other dependencies.
But how to initialize the node_modules/ folder and the package.json file for your project in the first
place? There is a npm command to initialize a npm project and thus a package.json file. Only when
you have that file, you can install new local packages via npm.
    </p>
    <p>Command Line</p>
    <pre>
        npm init -y
    </pre>
    <p>
        The -y flag is a shortcut to initialize all the defaults in your package.json. If you don’t use the flag,
you have to decide how to configure the file. After initializing your npm project you are good to
install new packages via npm install &lt;package&gt;.
One more word about the package.json. The file enables you to share your project with other
developers without sharing all the node packages. The file has all the references of node packages
used in your project. These packages are called dependencies. Everyone can copy your project
without the dependencies. The dependencies are references in the package.json. Someone who copies
your project can simply install all packages by using npm install on the command line. The npm
install script takes all the dependencies listed in the package.json file and installs them in the
node_modules/ folder.
I want to cover one more npm command:
    </p>
    <p>Command Line</p>
    <pre>
        npm install --save-dev &lt;package&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        The --save-dev flag indicates that the node package is only used in the development environment.
It will not be used in production when you deploy your application on a server. What kind of node
package could that be? Imagine you want to test your application with the help of a node package.
You need to install that package via npm, but want to exclude it from your production environment.
Testing should only happen during the development process but not when your application is already
running in production. There you don’t want to test your application anymore. It should be tested
already and work out of the box for your users. That’s only one use case where you would want to
use the --save-dev flag.
You will encounter more npm commands on your way. But these will be sufficient for now.
    </p>
    <h1>Exercises:</h1>
    <p>
• setup a throw away npm project
– create a new folder with mkdir &lt;folder_name&gt;
– navigate into the folder with cd &lt;folder_name&gt;
– execute npm init -y or npm init
– install a local package like React with npm install react
– have a look into the package.json file and the node_modules/ folder
– find out on your own how to uninstall the react node package again
    </p>
    <h1>Installation</h1>
    <p>
        There are multiple approaches to get started with a React application.
The first one is to use a CDN. That may sound more complicated than it is. A CDN is a content
delivery network44. Several companies have CDNs that host files publicly for people to consume
them. These files can be libraries like React, because after all the bundled React library is only a
react.js JavaScript file. It can be hosted somewhere and you can require it in your application.
How to use a CDN to get started in React? You can inline the  &lt;script&gt; tag in your HTML that points
to a CDN url. To get started in React you need two files (libraries): react and react-dom.
    </p>
    <pre>
&lt;script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.developmen\
t.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        But why should you use a CDN when you have npm to install node packages such as React?
When your application has a package.json file, you can install react and react-dom from the
command line. The requirement is that the folder is initialized as npm project by using npm init
-y with a package.json file. You can install multiple node packages in one line with npm.
    </p>
    <p>Command Line</p>
    <pre>
        npm install react react-dom
    </pre>
    <p>
        That approach is often used to add React to an existing application that is managed with npm.
Unfortunately that’s not everything. You would have to deal with Babel45 to make your application
aware of JSX (the React syntax) and JavaScript ES6. Babel transpiles your code so that browsers can
interpret JavaScript ES6 and JSX. Not all browsers are capable of interpreting the syntax. The setup
includes a lot of configuration and tooling. It can be overwhelming for React newcomers to bother
with all the configuration.
Because of this reason, Facebook introduced create-react-app as a zero-configuration React solution.
The next chapter will show you how to setup your application by using this bootstrapping tool.
    </p>
    <h1>Zero-Configuration Setup</h1>
    <p>
        In the Road to learn React, you will use create-react-app47 to bootstrap your application. It’s an
opinionated yet zero-configuration starter kit for React introduced by Facebook in 2016. People
would recommend it to beginners by 96%48. In create-react-app the tooling and configuration evolve
in the background while the focus is on the application implementation.
To get started, you will have to install the package to your global node packages. After that, you
always have it available on the command line to bootstrap new React applications.
    </p>
    <p>Command Line</p>
    <pre>
        npm install -g create-react-app
    </pre>
    <p>
        You can check the version of create-react-app to verify a successful installation on your command
line:
    </p>
    <p>Command Line</p>
    <pre>
        create-react-app --version
       *v1.5.1
    </pre>
    <p>
        Now you can bootstrap your first React application. We call it hackernews, but you can choose a
different name. The bootstrapping takes a couple of seconds. Afterward, simply navigate into the
folder:
    </p>
    <p>Command Line</p>
    <pre>
        create-react-app hackernews
     cd hackernews
    </pre>
    <p>
        Now you can open the application in your editor. The following folder structure, or a variation of it
depending on the create-react-app version, should be presented to you:
    </p>
    <p>Folder Structure</p>
    <pre>
        hackernews/
README.md
node_modules/
package.json
.gitignore
public/
favicon.ico
index.html
manifest.json
src/
App.css
App.js
App.test.js
index.css
index.js
logo.svg
registerServiceWorker.js
    </pre>
    <p>
        A short break down of the folder and files. It is fine if you don’t understand all of them in the
beginning.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>• README.md: </b> The .md extension indicates that the file is a markdown file. Markdown is
            used as a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Many source code
            projects come with a README.md file to give you initial instructions about the project. When
            pushing your project to a platform such as GitHub eventually, the README.md file will show
            its content prominently when you access the repository. Because you have used create-reactapp,
            your README.md should be the same as shown in the official create-react-app GitHub
            repository49.</li>
            <li>
                <b>node_modules/:</b> The folder has all the node packages that were and are installed via npm.
Since you have used create-react-app, there should be already a couple of node modules
installed for you. Usually you will never touch this folder, but only install and uninstall node
packages with npm from the command line.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>package.json:</b> The file shows you a list of node package dependencies and other project
configuration.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>• .gitignore: </b> The file indicates all files and folders that shouldn’t be added to your remote git
repository when using git. They should only live in your local project. The node_modules/
folder is such a use case. It is sufficient to share the package.json file with your peers to
enable them to install all dependencies on their own without sharing the whole dependency
folder.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>• public/:</b> The folder holds all your files when building your project for production. Eventually
all your written code in the src/ folder will be bundled into a couple of files when building
your project and placed in the public folder.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>• manifest.json and registerServiceWorker.js:</b> don’t worry about what these files do at this
stage, we won’t be needing them in this project.
            </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        After all, you don’t need to touch the mentioned files and folders. In the beginning everything you
need is located in the src/ folder. The main focus lies on the src/App.js file to implement React
components. It will be used to implement your application, but later you might want to split up
your components into multiple files whereas each file maintains one or a few components on its
own.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, you will find a src/App.test.js file for your tests and a src/index.js as entry point to the
React world. You will get to know both files in a later chapter. In addition, there is a src/index.css
and a src/App.css file to style your general application and your components. They all come with
default style when you open them.
    </p>
    <p>The create-react-app application is a npm project. You can use npm to install and uninstall node
        packages to your project. Additionally it comes with the following npm scripts for your command
        line:</p>
        <p>Command Line</p>
        <pre>
            // Runs the application in http://localhost:3000
npm start
// Runs the tests
npm test
// Builds the application for production
npm run build
        </pre>
        <p>The scripts are defined in your package.json. Your boilerplate React application is bootstrapped now.
            The exciting part comes in the exercises to finally run your bootstrapped application in the browser.</p>
