    <h1>ES6 const and let</h1>
    <P>
        I guess you noticed that we declared the variable helloWorld with a var statement. JavaScript ES6
        comes with two more options to declare your variables: const and let. In JavaScript ES6, you will
        rarely find var anymore.
        A variable declared with const cannot be re-assigned or re-declared. It cannot get mutated (changed,
        modified). You embrace immutable data structures by using it. Once the data structure is defined,
        you cannot change it.
    </P>
    <P>Code Playground</P>
    <pre translate="no">// not allowed
        const helloWorld = 'Welcome to the Road to learn React';
        helloWorld = 'Bye Bye React';</pre>
    <p>A variable declared with let can get mutated.</p>
    <pre>// allowed
            let helloWorld = 'Welcome to the Road to learn React';
            helloWorld = 'Bye Bye React';</pre>
    <p>
        You would use it when you would need to re-assign a variable.
        However, you have to be careful with const. A variable declared with const cannot get modified.
        But when the variable is an array or object, the value it holds can get updated. The value it holds is
        not immutable.
    </p>
    <p>Code Playground</p>
    <pre translate="no">
    // allowed
    const helloWorld = {
    text: 'Welcome to the Road to learn React'
    };
    helloWorld.text = 'Bye Bye React';
   </pre>
    <p>
        But when to use each declaration? There are different opinions about the usage. I suggest using
        const whenever you can. It indicates that you want to keep your data structure immutable even
        though values in objects and arrays can get modified. If you want to modify your variable, you can
        use let.
        Immutability is embraced in React and its ecosystem. Thatâ€™s why const should be your default
        choice when you define a variable. Still, in complex objects the values within can get modified. Be
        careful about this behavior.
        In your application, you should use const over var.

    <pre translate="no">
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import './App.css';
    class App extends Component {
    render() {
    const helloWorld = 'Welcome to the Road to learn React';
    return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;{helloWorld}&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    );
    }
    }
    export default App;
